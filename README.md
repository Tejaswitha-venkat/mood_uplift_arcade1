# Mood Uplift Arcade ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜Š
A lightweight, offline-friendly web app packed with mood-uplifting mini games (Whack-a-Stress, Catch the Smile, Bubble Pop) + a Joke Quiz, mood notes, jokes, and quotes.

## Quick start
1. Download & unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Play! (No build step needed).

## Features
- **Mood input & analysis** (simple word-based sentiment to keep it offline).
- **Arcade hub** with 4 mini experiences:
  - Whack-a-Stress
  - Catch the Smile (canvas)
  - Bubble Pop (canvas)
  - Joke Quiz
- **High scores** and **mood logs** saved in LocalStorage.
- **Random jokes & uplifting quotes** after each game.

## Notes
- This project is for fun and well-being, not a medical tool.
- All logic is vanilla JS + Canvas, no frameworks.
- You can expand with APIs (e.g., Imgflip for memes, Joke API) if you want live content.

## Extend ideas
- Add a **meme stream** using an external API with `fetch()`.
- Personalize recommendations: map mood to suggested game.
- Add sound effects for pops and catches.
- Deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Enjoy building & sharing smiles! ðŸ˜Š
